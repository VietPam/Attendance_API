# HRMS - Human Resources Management System

## About this Project:

The purpose of this project is to develop an HRMS (Human Resources Management System) to efficiently manage departments, employees, positions, and performance evaluations within an organization.

## Why?

The HRMS aims to streamline HR processes, enhance employee management, and facilitate performance evaluation procedures. By leveraging modern technologies and adhering to best practices, this system ensures effective management of human resources.
